Strategic tips for performing OSINT investigations


## Uniqueness of Information
* How unique is a piece of information?  And what does that mean?
    * How many people are named John Thompson vs. How many people have the phone number 555-666-7777?
* How can we link unique pieces of information together?
    * Cross-verify pieces of information.
     * Ex:  Let's say sus. John Thompson (555-666-7777) lives at 123 Central Ave.
     * And sus. John H. Thompson (jt63xyz@gmail.com) lives at 123 Central Ave.
      * It's fair to conclude that there MAY be a connection between these 2 Johns (this may be the same John).

## Verifying information
* Look up a phone number (just google it - XXX YYY ZZZZ)
* Then look up the phone number PLUS a sus. name
 * ex:  Google "John Thompson XXX YYY ZZZZ"
* The difference in results from *just* searching the phone number can be quite a bit more specific (and more accurate)
* Keep in mind you can theoretically get some insanely granular results using this technique
 * ex:  What if we search their name, phone, and address?  (ex:  John Thompson XXX YYY ZZZZ 123 Central Ave.)
